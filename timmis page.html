            <h2> ABOUT ME: </h2>
            <p> Hello! My name is Timmi. I am a up and coming front-end developer with big dreams! I love the arts and everything about it! I often joke about how I can do everything BUT dance. I love to create music, paint pictures, make clay molds, crochet, and even more! I love challenging myself with new projects with the goal of cultivating a new skill. I fell in love with front-end becuase it's like a big puzzle to me! I often find myself engaging in a lot of "brain games" and I see this a one big puzzle. Making mistakes, not knowing what code to put in, and even being stumped with something doesn't process; fuels me to keep going. I am a natural problem-solver at heart. Also, if you didn't notice, my favorite color is <span id="pink"> pink.</span> I'm from Monroe, Louisiana but moved to Texas at the age of 7 years old. I am very grateful to my mom for moving from the country to a more urban environment. Before getting into tech, I found myself being very fascinated with AI.I've studied and done a deep dive into the integral parts of AI. I love the process and makeup of what AI is and would love to find myself behind a model.</p>
